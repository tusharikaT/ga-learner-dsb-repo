Your friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As you have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new-found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.
You can see that some of the features of Type, Method,SellerG,CouncilArea, and Regionname in the data are textual in nature. Don't worry, we have made things simple for you with some behind-the-scenes data preprocessing. You will learn about all these preprocessing techniques in a later concept. For now, let's concentrate on getting the Melbourne Housing data in your hands soon. :)

The dataset has details of 6830 house entries with the following 16 features

Feature	Description
Rooms	Number of rooms
Type	Property type
Price	Price in dollars
Method	Property status
SellerG	Real Estate Agent
Distance	Distance from CBD
Postcode	Code of the area
Bathroom	Number of Bathrooms
Car	Number of carspots
Landsize	Land Size
BuildingArea	Building Size
YearBuilt	The year in which home was built
CouncilArea	Governing council for the area
Longtitude	The angular distance of a place east or west
Regionname	General Region (West, North West, North, Northeast â€¦etc)
PropertyCount	Number of properties that exist in the suburb
