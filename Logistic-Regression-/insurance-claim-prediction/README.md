Till now you have seen that how to solve the linear regression and regularization problem. Now in this project, you are going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
